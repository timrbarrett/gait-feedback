Thoughts:

BLE transits from Genuino101, 
	but it does not transmit the correct buffer contents
	correction - it looks like it sends what was requested.
	
BLE does not receive text from the android device at all.

TODOs:
	Fix the text squirted to the SD card.
	
	TRB_IMU_H
		prune unused private variables
			ax,y,z
			gx,y,z
			pitch, roll, heading
			accelScale, gyroScale
			
			all the char out definitions.
			
		prune unused conversion methods
			raw acceleration
			raw gyro
	
	TRB_Time
	
		fix getFilename()
		could strcpy all values
		
	TRB_BLE
	
		remove (int dummy) from constructor
		
	in main
	
		if (millis() > futureTime) {
			close the file:
			Serial.println("File closed");
		}
